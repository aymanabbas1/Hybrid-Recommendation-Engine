# Hybrid Recommendation System

A hybrid recommendation system combines content-based and collaborative filtering methods to enhance recommendation accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both approaches.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Data Collection

- Collect explicit feedback from users such as ratings and preferences.
- Gather user interaction data with items (e.g., likes, clicks).

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Clean and preprocess data to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical features.

### 3. Fitting the Model with BPR Loss

- Use Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss to optimize for ROC AUC.
- Maximize the prediction difference between positive and randomly selected negative feedback using pairwise loss.

### 4. Evaluation of the Model

- Evaluate model accuracy using metrics such as precision at k (k-precision) and ROC AUC.
- k-precision determines if predictions rank within the top k results.
- ROC AUC measures the likelihood of a known positive being ranked higher than a randomly chosen negative.

### 5. Fitting the Model with WARP Loss

- Apply Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss to optimize top recommendations.
- Continuously sample negative feedback to maximize the rank of positive interactions.

### 6. Recommendation Generation and Continual Feedback Loop

- Generate recommendations using both content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
- Incorporate ongoing user feedback and interactions to refine recommendations.

This README outlines the steps involved in implementing a hybrid recommendation system, emphasizing the integration of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to improve recommendation effectiveness.
